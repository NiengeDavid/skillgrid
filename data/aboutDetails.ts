      "After years of teaching coding to beginners, I realized most courses move too fast and leave students frustrated. I founded SkillGrid to change that.",
      "Our approach focuses on hands-on learning from day one. We don't just teach syntax - we teach problem-solving and creative thinking through code.",
      "What excites me most is seeing students transform from 'I could never code' to 'I built this myself!' That moment keeps me motivated every day.",
