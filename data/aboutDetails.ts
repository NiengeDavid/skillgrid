      "After over 7 years of working in the tech space, I saw a pattern: most digital training programs in Nigeria are either too abstract, too rushed, or not designed for real learning. Many people — kids, teens, even adults — were consuming tech daily but lacked the structure and support to build with it.",

      "I didn’t start SkillGrid because I’m a software developer. I started it because I saw a bigger need — a need to make practical tech skills accessible, simple, and empowering for everyday Nigerians, no matter their age.",

      "SkillGrid is about more than coding — it’s about helping people unlock opportunity through tech, whether that’s by learning to build websites, understanding cybersecurity, using digital tools for business, or just having a solid foundation for the future.",

      "This Kids Coding Bootcamp is one of our initiatives. We’re training kids aged 10–16 because we believe the earlier you plant the seed, the stronger the future grows.",

      "What drives me is seeing people — especially young people — go from “I could never do this” to “I built this myself.” That’s the moment we live for at SkillGrid.",

      "👇 Want your child to be part of this journey?",

      "Join the WhatsApp Group and get all the Bootcamp details.",
